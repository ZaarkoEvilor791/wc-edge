# wc-edge Project Guide

**Project:** FIFA WC 2026 Fantasy Companion Tool — squad builder, transfer advisor, captain picker, live tracker, and Edge AI advisor.

**Deadline:** June 11, 2026 (Day 8). Tournament starts June 12, 2026.

**Production URL:** `https://wc-edge.onrender.com`

**Local dev:** frontend at `http://localhost:5173`, Express API at `http://localhost:3001`

**Database:** Render Postgres (free tier, 256MB)

**PRD:** https://github.com/ZaarkoEvilor791/fpl-edge/issues/12

**Full design doc:** `wc-edge.md` in this repo

**Parent project:** `fpl-edge` at `../fpl-edge` — copy patterns from there, not code

---

## Session Context (read this first)

**Session 1 (2026-06-04) — repo scaffolded, planning complete:**

- Design grilling complete — all pages, API routes, and deployment fully specified
- PRD published at https://github.com/ZaarkoEvilor791/fpl-edge/issues/12
- Repo scaffolded, wc-edge.md copied (API key scrubbed), CLAUDE.md written

**Session 2 (2026-06-04) — infra complete, engine scaffolded, ready for Phase 1 scrape:**

- `wc-edge-prd.md` written and committed (full PRD with user stories + test strategy)
- `render.yaml` created — DB stanza removed (Render free tier allows only 1 DB; reusing fpl-edge Postgres)
- Render web service live at `https://wc-edge.onrender.com`
- **Database:** reusing fpl-edge Postgres (`fpledge` DB). Internal URL set in Render env. External URL in `engine/.env`.

**Session 3 (2026-06-04) — Day 1 engine complete, Phase 1 scrape done:**

- All engine foundation files written: `config.py`, `db.py`, `__init__.py`, `requirements.txt`
- **Schema updated:** all tables now under `wc` Postgres schema (`CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS wc`) to avoid collision with fpl-edge's `players`/`teams` tables on the shared DB. All queries use `wc.tablename`.
- `db.py` sets `search_path=wc,public` on connect — no schema prefix needed in SQL
- **`wc_ingest.py` written** — all 4 sources: statsbomb, sofascore, fifa, apif
- **Phase 1 scrape complete (Day 1):**
  - StatsBomb: 199 match files, 1,441 unique players cached → `engine/data/sb_cache.json`
  - Sofascore: **403 blocked** (Cloudflare). AFCON 2025 players fall back to AFCON 2023 StatsBomb data.
  - FIFA Fantasy: 1,481 players (48-team WC 2026), 8 rounds, 32 squads upserted to DB
  - API-Football: 107 players with club stats upserted. **Budget used: 80/100 today.**
- **DB state after Day 1:**
  - `wc.players`: 1,481 rows
  - `wc.teams`: 32 rows
  - `wc.rounds`: 8 rows
  - `wc.player_stats`: 571 rows (520 with tournament stats, 106 with club stats, 56 with both)
  - `engine/data/unmatched_players.json`: 961 players for Day 3 review
- **Known bugs fixed during this session:**
  1. API-Football `/players/topscorers` has no `page` parameter — `&page=1` returns error. Fixed to single request per league, no pagination.
  2. Abbreviated API-Football names ("A. Isak") added last-name-only fallback in `_resolve_element()`
  3. All `wc_schema.sql` tables prefixed with `wc.` namespace
- **Next session starts here (Day 2):** Run `python -m engine.wc_ingest --source apif --day 2` (fresh 100 req/day budget) + scaffold web/ directory (TypeScript types, React Query hooks, sidebar icons)

---

## How to Start (Day 1 steps)

### 1. Set the GitHub secret (do this once)
```bash
gh secret set API_FOOTBALL_KEY --repo ZaarkoEvilor791/wc-edge
# paste the key when prompted
```

### 2. Create engine/.env (local, gitignored)
```
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=<key>
DATABASE_URL=<render-external-connection-string — set after Render deploy>
```

### 3. Run Phase 1 scrape
```bash
cd engine
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # Windows: use py launcher, not python
py -m engine.wc_ingest --source statsbomb   # 199 match files, ~2 min, free (DONE Day 1)
py -m engine.wc_ingest --source sofascore   # AFCON 2025 — currently 403 blocked, skip
py -m engine.wc_ingest --source fifa        # players.json + rounds + squads, free (DONE Day 1)
py -m engine.wc_ingest --source apif --day 1 # Day 1 budget used (80/100). DONE.
py -m engine.wc_ingest --source apif --day 2 # Run Day 2 on June 5 — fresh 100 req quota
```

**IMPORTANT — API-Football notes:**
- `/players/topscorers` has NO `page` parameter — already handled in code
- Budget file: `engine/data/apif_budget.json` tracks day1_used (80 already) and day2_used
- Day 2 run uses `--day 2` flag to use day2_used counter

### 4. Check unmatched players
```bash
py -m engine.wc_ingest --report  # prints unmatched_players.json sorted by price
```
Review manually on Day 3. Add hard cases to `engine/data/name_overrides.json`.

## How to Run (local dev)

```bash
# Frontend + API server
cd web
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173 + http://localhost:3001

# Engine
cd engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m engine.wc_run          # Phase 2: recompute projections
python -m engine.wc_ingest ...   # Phase 1: scrape data sources
```

## Database Schema

5 tables from `wc-edge.md` §4 plus one addition:

```sql
-- player_stats, projections, team_fdr, players, teams (see wc-edge.md §4)

-- ADDITION: pre-computed squad suggestion
CREATE TABLE suggested_squad (
    id           SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    round        INTEGER NOT NULL,
    squad_json   JSONB NOT NULL,
    total_xp     REAL,
    total_cost   REAL,
    computed_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX ON suggested_squad (round);
```

---

## Deployment

**Render Blueprint (`render.yaml`):**
```yaml
databases:
  - name: wc-db
    databaseName: wc_edge
    plan: free

services:
  - type: web
    name: wc-edge
    env: node
    plan: free
    buildCommand: cd web && npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: node web/dist/server/server.js
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromDatabase:
          name: wc-db
          property: connectionString
      - key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        sync: false
```

**GitHub Actions secrets:**
- `DATABASE_URL` — Render external Postgres connection string
- `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` — API-Football key

**Trigger engine manually:**
```bash
gh workflow run engine.yml --repo ZaarkoEvilor791/wc-edge
```

---

## Key Decisions (from grilling session)

- **`highs` npm package stays** — Squad Builder uses HiGHS-WASM for Re-optimize. The original wc-edge.md note to remove it is wrong.
- **`chatApi.ts` is NOT verbatim reuse** — must pass `squad: number[]` alongside messages (no teamId equivalent).
- **API Football key is gitignored** — live in `engine/.env` and GitHub secret only. Never commit.
- **Squad is never empty on load** — always pre-filled from `suggested_squad` DB table.
- **Transfers is one-at-a-time** — single swap card, Accept/Skip flow, sequential greedy.
- **Captain is squad-only** — 15 rows, no global player list.
- **Live is always accessible** — no RequireSquad guard. Degrades gracefully with stale banner.
- **Captain swap is advisory** — banner links to play.fifa.com/fantasy/ directly, no in-app execution.
- **WC gold accent** — `#E8B84B` in tailwind.config.ts, replaces fpl-edge teal `#00D8CB`.

## Brand & Design

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `accent` | `#E8B84B` | WC gold — buttons, active states |
| `accent-fg` | `#060D18` | Text on gold backgrounds |
| `slate-950` | `#060D18` | Body background |
| `slate-900` | `#0A1321` | Main surface / sidebar |
| `slate-800` | `#0F1E31` | Cards / panels |
| `slate-700` | `#162B3F` | Hover / raised |
| `slate-600` | `#1E3550` | Borders |
| `slate-400` | `#6B8EA8` | Body text |
| `slate-100` | `#E0EEF8` | Primary text |

**No purple/violet.** Sidebar pattern identical to fpl-edge (collapsible, Zustand, inline SVG icons).

---

## Scoring Constants

```python
GOAL_PTS = {1: 9, 2: 7, 3: 6, 4: 5}   # GK/DEF/MID/FWD
CS_PTS   = {1: 5, 2: 5, 3: 1, 4: 0}
ASSIST_PTS = 3
APPEARANCE_FULL = 2   # >= 60 min
APPEARANCE_PART = 1   # < 60 min
SAVES_PER_PT = 3      # GK: +1 per 3 saves
YELLOW_CARD = -1
RED_CARD = -2
SCOUTING_BONUS = 2    # >= 4 pts + < 5% ownership
```

## Gotchas

- **StatsBomb 199 files** — download with 0.5s delay, ~2 min total. No rate limit but be polite.
- **API-Football 100 req/day hard cap** — track carefully. Budget in wc-edge.md §2.
- **Sofascore unofficial** — no auth needed but may break without warning. AFCON 2025 only.
- **Community live API (worldcup2026-api.vercel.app)** — no SLA. Degraded mode is a primary design constraint, not an edge case.
- **suggested_squad table must be populated** before Squad page works — run wc_optimizer.py after Phase 2.
- **Day 3 manual step** — review unmatched_players.json, add overrides to name_overrides.json before Day 4 Phase 1 re-run. Cannot be automated.
